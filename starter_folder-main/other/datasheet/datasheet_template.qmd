Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.


**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset was created to track and document the deaths of individuals in Torontoâ€™s shelter system, in order to provide transparency, assist in policymaking, and improve the understanding of health outcomes among shelter residents.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The dataset was created and published by Open Data Toronto, a public-facing platform for sharing municipal data in the City of Toronto.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - Yes, the goal was to provide a public record of deaths among shelter residents to support the development of public health initiatives and to provide insights into the vulnerabilities faced by the shelter population.
4. *Any other comments?*
    - No.

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- Each instance represents a reported death of an individual who resided in a shelter in the City of Toronto from 2007 onwards.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- As of the latest version of the dataset (retrieved in 2024), there are 467 reported deaths of shelter residents.
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is not a random sample but contains all recorded instances of deaths among shelter residents in Toronto. It reflects all known data within a specific time period (beginning in January 2007 and onward). The dataset aims to be comprehensive in covering the total number of shelter resident deaths in the city within the documented timeframe.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance in the dataset consists of a record of a death among shelter residents, including various features such as:
The date of death.
_Age and gender of the individual.
_Location of death (hospital, shelter, or other).
_Primary cause of death (illness, drug overdose, etc.).
_The shelter location (if available).
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Yes, the primary cause of death can be considered a label for each instance, categorizing deaths by cause (e.g., natural causes, overdose, etc.).
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Some instances may have missing data for specific fields, such as the exact location of death or the cause of death if not determined or recorded. These omissions likely occur due to the unavailability of certain information at the time of recording.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- No explicit relationships between individual instances are documented in the dataset. Each instance is independent and refers to a unique death record.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- No specific data splits are recommended in the dataset. The dataset provides a complete set of records, and any splits (e.g., by year, cause of death, or age group) would depend on the specific analysis goals.
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Some entries may have missing or incomplete data due to reporting issues. Additionally, potential redundancies may exist if a death was mistakenly recorded twice, but this would be rare given the seriousness of the documentation process.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset is self-contained and does not rely on external data sources. All information provided is from official records collected and managed by the city of Toronto.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- While the dataset does not contain personally identifiable information (PII), it does include sensitive information related to individuals' deaths, which may be considered confidential from a public health or ethical standpoint.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- Yes, the dataset contains information about the deaths of vulnerable individuals, including causes such as overdose or violence, which could cause distress or anxiety.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- The dataset provides information on sub-populations, such as the age and gender of the deceased individuals. However, it does not provide detailed demographic data beyond these categories.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- No, it is not possible to directly identify individuals from the dataset. Personal identifiers like names or addresses are not included, and the dataset anonymizes individuals by focusing on aggregate data like gender, age, and cause of death.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Yes, the dataset contains sensitive data related to health, death, and possible vulnerabilities, such as drug use or homelessness, which may be considered sensitive for the purposes of ethical use and analysis.
16. *Any other comments?*
	- This dataset provides valuable insight into public health issues affecting shelter residents in Toronto, but care must be taken when interpreting the data due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter.

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
	- The data was directly reported by the City of Toronto's shelter system. It includes information on shelter deaths and has been validated by city officials responsible for managing the dataset.
2. *What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?*
	- The data collection was done manually by shelter staff reporting deaths, later compiled into a centralized dataset by the City of Torontoâ€™s data infrastructure team. Verification occurred via internal reporting mechanisms.
3. *If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (for example, deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?*
	- The dataset is not a sample but an attempt to provide a complete record of all shelter resident deaths within Toronto's shelter system. No probabilistic sampling was done; it is an exhaustive record rather than a sample.
4. *Who was involved in the data collection process (for example, students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (for example, how much were crowdworkers paid)?*
	- Data was collected by shelter staff and public health officials employed by the City of Toronto. No external contractors or crowdworkers were used.
5. *Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (for example, recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.*
	- The dataset covers deaths from 2007 to the present. The data is updated regularly to reflect new instances. The creation of the dataset mirrors the real-time reporting of deaths as they occur.
6. *Were any ethical review processes conducted (for example, by an institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.*
	- No formal institutional review board (IRB) process was mentioned, but the dataset complies with municipal and public health guidelines on data privacy and reporting.
7. *Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (for example, websites)?*
	- The data was reported by shelter staff after the fact, not directly from individuals. The shelter system and city officials provided the information.
8. *Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language of the notification itself.*
	- Since the dataset involves posthumous data on deceased individuals, no direct notification was required. However, it is publicly available under the City of Torontoâ€™s open data policies.
9. *Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals consented.*
	- Given the nature of the dataset (deceased individuals), explicit consent was not applicable. Data collection is handled under public health and city regulations.
10. *If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses? If so, please provide a description, as well as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate).*
	- Not applicable, as consent was not required in this context.
11. *Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects (for example, a data protection impact analysis) been conducted? If so, please provide a description of this analysis, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.*
	- No formal impact analysis was conducted specifically for this dataset, but public datasets released by the City of Toronto follow legal and ethical data privacy standards to prevent misuse of sensitive information.
12. *Any other comments?*
	- The dataset follows strict privacy guidelines, ensuring no personal identifying information is included that could compromise the privacy of individuals, especially in sensitive cases such as death.

**Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling**

1. *Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (for example, discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.*
	- Yes, the data underwent cleaning to remove any erroneous entries and handle missing values. This involved standardizing date formats and ensuring consistency across fields such as cause of death and shelter name.
2. *Was the "raw" data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (for example, to support unanticipated future uses)? If so, please provide a link or other access point to the "raw" data.*
	- Yes, the raw data is available on the City of Toronto's Open Data portal. It can be accessed at https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/deaths-of-shelter-residents/.
3. *Is the software that was used to preprocess/clean/label the data available? If so, please provide a link or other access point.*
	- The preprocessing was likely done using internal data tools by the City of Toronto. Public information on specific software used for cleaning is not provided.
4. *Any other comments?*
	- The data is regularly reviewed to ensure it is up-to-date and accurate as part of the city's public health reporting.

**Uses**

1. *Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Yes, the dataset has been used for public health analysis, reporting by city officials, and by researchers to study the conditions of Torontoâ€™s homeless population, particularly focusing on mortality trends.
2. *Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or systems that use the dataset? If so, please provide a link or other access point.*
	- There is no centralized repository specifically linking all papers or systems using the dataset, but the Open Data Toronto portal provides access to the dataset and some use cases.
3. *What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?*
	- The dataset can be used for various analyses, including public policy evaluations, trends in homelessness and health outcomes, and mortality modeling. It could also be used to inform services aimed at reducing mortality rates in shelters.
4. *Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (for example, stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (for example, legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms?*
	- The dataset may lack detailed context about each death (e.g., underlying medical conditions, social factors), which could affect the depth of analysis for certain research purposes. Itâ€™s also essential to handle this sensitive dataset ethically, considering the vulnerable population it represents.
5. *Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset should not be used to draw conclusions about individual cases or for purposes that could lead to stigmatization or unfair treatment of the homeless population.
6. *Any other comments?*
